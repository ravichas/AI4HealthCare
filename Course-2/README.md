## Project Overview

### Quantification of Hippocampus Volume in Alzheimer's Disease Progression

## Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as a progressive neurodegenerative condition characterized by compromised 
neuronal function leading to eventual cell death. This disorder represents the leading cause of dementia, 
marked by clinical indicators such as memory loss, diminished capacity for new learning, language function 
decline, and other discernible manifestations.

For individuals presenting initial symptoms, the ability to quantify disease advancement over time 
holds significant potential in guiding therapeutic interventions and disease management strategies.

Among the various techniques available, radiological assessments utilizing MRI examinations stand out 
as a sophisticated means of quantifying disease progression. In particular, the measurement of hippocampal 
volume has emerged as a valuable tool for diagnosing and monitoring the progression of numerous brain 
disorders, prominently including AD. Substantiated by studies, a notable reduction in hippocampal volume 
has been consistently observed in AD patients.

The hippocampus, a pivotal structure within the human brain (as well as in the brains of other vertebrates), 
plays a critical role in consolidating information from short-term memory into long-term memory. 
In essence, the hippocampus is widely recognized as the center responsible for memory and learning 
processes, forming the foundation for our cognitive abilities.

Humans possess a pair of hippocampi, with one situated within each hemisphere of the brain. 
These vital structures are situated in the medial temporal lobe. An intriguing tidbit - the 
term "hippocampus" finds its origins in Greek, approximately translating to "horselike," 
owing to its resemblance to a seahorse, as noted by one of the early anatomists who 
depicted the structure. This analogy becomes apparent upon viewing the accompanying image.`

As noted by Nobis et al. (2019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158219302542)),the hippocampal volume exhibits variation within a population, encompassing 
specific parameters and defined limits. It becomes feasible to establish a "normal" range by considering 
factors such as age, sex, and brain hemisphere.

This phenomenon is visually demonstrated in the accompanying image, illustrating the right 
hippocampal volume of women spanning ages 52 to 71.
