# Course-1: Applying AI to 2D Medical Imaging Data

(*Please note that most of this section writeup was from Udacity and I have summarized portions of the writeup*)

## Project Overview

This project has 2 primary components: 

1) Pulse Rate Algorithm Development:
Your journey commences with the development of a Pulse Rate Algorithm, drawing insights 
from the provided training data. Your task encompasses crafting an algorithm that accurately 
determines pulse rates. Subsequent to its creation, rigorous testing shall be conducted to validate 
that the algorithm satisfactorily fulfills predefined success criteria. This phase serves as the 
foundational cornerstone, showcasing your ability to translate data into actionable insights.

2) Clinical Application Integration and Healthcare Trends Discovery:
The second facet of this project delves into the practical application of your Pulse Rate Algorithm 
within a clinical context. Your algorithm is harnessed to compute a gamut of clinically meaningful 
features that extend beyond the realm of pulse rates. Within this arena, your mission transforms 
into a quest for healthcare trendsâ€”illuminating patterns, correlations, and insights that 
contribute to our understanding of healthcare dynamics. Through this exploration, you stand 
poised to uncover invaluable insights that have the potential to reshape medical practices and patient care.
