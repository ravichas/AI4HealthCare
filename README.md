# AI for HealthCare 
  Udacity Nanodegree

The AI for Healthcare Udacity nanodegree program comprises of four courses that apply AI techniques to 
a diverse range of data, including 2D and 3D medical imaging data, as well as 
Electronic Health Record (EHR) and wearable device data.


### Prerequisites: 
   Intermediate Python and machine learning experience 

### Required Hardware/Sofware: 
   Python, PyTorch, and Aequitas (https://pypi.org/project/aequitas/); GPU access for creating models.

### [Course-1: Applying AI to 2D Medical Imaging Data](Course-1/README.md)

The initial course focuses on foundational skills necessary for effectively working with 2D imaging data. 
This includes tasks such as extracting images from DICOM files, constructing AI models, 
and navigating the regulatory approval process. As part of the course project, students 
engage in training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify chest X-rays for the 
presence of pneumonia. Additionally, they learn to formulate an FDA validation plan to ensure the reliability of their AI models.

### [Course-2: Applying AI to 3D Medical Imaging Data](Course-2/README.md)

The second course delves into the realm of 3D imaging data, encompassing clinical fundamentals, various 
imaging modalities, and common analysis techniques. The curriculum also delves into the integration of AI 
into the clinical workflow. These courses (first two) collectively equip students with the knowledge and skills 
necessary to extract valuable insights from medical imaging data using AI methodologies.

### [Course-3: Applying AI to Electronic Health Record (EHR) Data](Course-3/README.md)

The third course centers on employing AI techniques with Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. In 
today's dynamic landscape, EHR data has taken on a critical role as a cornerstone of 
Real-World Evidence (RWE). Its significance extends to both the pharmaceutical industry and 
regulatory entities, influencing decisions crucial to the orchestration of clinical trials. In this course, 
participants assume the persona of data scientists immersed in a groundbreaking healthcare startup, 
evoking the spirit of an exhilarating unicorn enterprise. This startup has pioneered an innovative 
diabetes treatment on the cusp of being administered to patients.

As part of this engaging journey, participants take on the pivotal task of curating and refining the 
pool of patients slated for inclusion in the study. This endeavor calls for meticulous selection and 
filtering, accentuating the importance of precision in patient cohort assembly.

Through the utilization of TensorFlow, you will construct essential categorical and numerical feature 
transformations, crucial for the analysis. Furthermore, you will fashion a model and harness an array 
of analytical frameworks, including TF and Aequitas. These frameworks serve as tools to rigorously 
assess model bias and uncertainty, thus ensuring the robustness and integrity of your AI-driven 
decision-making processes.

### [Course-4: Applying AI to Wearable Device Data](Course-4/README.md) 

Wearable devices stand as a burgeoning source of physical health data, promising to enrich a patient's 
health insights through continuous, unobtrusive monitoring. This technology bears the potential to 
significantly augment our understanding of a patient's well-being. A fundamental grasp of the 
operational intricacies behind three pivotal sensors -namely, IMU, PPG, and ECG- ubiquitous 
in wearable devices, coupled with a foundational understanding of signal processing, serves as  
key for success in this area.

These wearable devices integrate a myriad of sensors, all concurrently capturing information from the 
same individuval. By amalgamating these diverse data streams, an array of tasks previously deemed unattainable
through a soitary sensor become feasible.  In the scope 
of this project, our endeavor encompasses the creation of an algorithm that synergizes insights 
from two sensors featured in this course -the IMU and PPG sensors. This algorithm's primary 
task involves estimating the wearer's pulse rate even in the presence of motion-induced artifacts.

The initial step entails the crafting and assessment of an activity classification algorithm. This endeavor 
necessitates the formulation of a signal activity classifier along with frequency domain techniques. 
Accompanying this, an associated confidence metric will be developed, instrumental in gauging the 
precision of the pulse rate estimation. The project culminates with a rigorous evaluation of 
the algorithm's performance. This evaluation process will undergo iterative refinement, 
persisting until the desired level of accuracy is accomplished.
